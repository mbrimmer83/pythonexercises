## Differences between Python and Javascript

## No semicolons in Python
n = 1

## No curry braces to denote code blocks, use indentation

## Use colon to start a sub-code-block
## if you don't indent correctly, it's a syntax error

if n > 1:
    print 'true'

for n in numbers:
    print n
    print n, 'again'

def add(x, y)
    return x + y

## Plain objects in JS are dictionaries
## Javascript
var student = {
    name: 'Allen',
    score: 91
}

## Python
student = {
 'name': 'Allen',
 'score': 91
}

## Arrays are called lists in Python

## Constructors are called classes in Python

## Imports instead of requires in Python
